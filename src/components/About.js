                <p> 
                    I'm Maxine, a recent sofware engineering graduate of Flatiron School.

                <p>
                    I embarked on my journey as a programmer during my last semester of college, when I took a Java and Python class for fun. 
                    Come around end of semester, I was planning out which languages I wanted to learn next. As an environmental sciences/engineering major, and STEM nerd,
                    coding always sparked an interest in me. So, if there's one thing I regret, it's 
                    not starting it sooner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That doesn't mean I wasn't busy! While completing a degree fulltime, I became a mother and lead 
                    preschool teacher. Tackling all three of these tasks simutanously taught me more than you could imagine, 
                    and ultimately made me into the problem solver I am today. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a love for helping others, 
                    I hope to utilize programming in ways to make our world a better place.
