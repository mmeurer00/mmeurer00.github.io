                <h3>Hi!</h3>
                <p> 
                    I'm Maxine, a recent sofware engineering graduate of Flatiron School.

                    My journey as a programmer began my last semester of college when I decided to take 
                    a Java and Python class for fun. Come around end of semester, I was planning out which languages I wanted to learn next.

                    As an environmental sciences/engineering major, and STEM nerd,
                    coding always sparked an interest in me. And, if there's one thing I regret, it's 
                    not starting it sooner. But, in the interim, I recieved a ton of priceless life experience.

                    Prior to my life of watching tech talks, while I was still completing my degree fulltime, I became a mother. As many know, being a 
                    parent is an every day lesson and challenge in itself, so if that wasn't enough, I also became a 
                    head pre-school teacher. Tackling all three of these tasks simutanously taught me more than you could imagine, 
                    and ultimately made me into the problem solving programmer I am today.

                    With a love for, and background, in humanitarian and environmental studies, 
                    I hope to utilize programming in ways to make our world a better place.
